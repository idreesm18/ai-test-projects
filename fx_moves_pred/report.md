  "question": "Based on the macroeconomic environment as of January 1, 2022, with notable inflation fears, central bank cautiousness, and geopolitical risks, I need to identify three FX trades with high potential for appreciation or depreciation over the next year. To do this, I require insights on currencies most vulnerable to inflation pressures, monetary policy normalization, and geopolitical events. Specifically, which currencies are likely to weaken if inflation fears lead to more cautious central bank approaches, and which currencies are poised to strengthen if recovery momentum and wider yield differentials favor them? Additionally, identify any notable divergences from historical patterns or current market dislocations that could signal unorthodox opportunities, considering regional vulnerabilities, fiscal and political developments, and shifts in market sentiment.\n\nThe context involves a global environment marked by heightened volatility, unorthodox moves, and sector-specific stresses, particularly in credit and sovereign markets. This macro backdrop can significantly influence currency trajectories, especially in the face of differing regional responses to inflation, growth prospects, and policy shifts. Please incorporate these considerations into your analysis to pinpoint three compelling FX trades for the upcoming year.",
