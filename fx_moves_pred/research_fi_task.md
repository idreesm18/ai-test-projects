- United States: In 2021, the US fixed income market experienced a rising rate environment especially in Q1, driven by inflation expectations and Fed tapering signals. Treasury yields increased with the 10-year yield reaching around 1.7%. Inflation-linked securities (TIPS) outperformed nominal Treasuries, with the Morningstar U.S. TIPS Index returning approximately 5.7%. ETF flows into bonds surged, capturing about 40% of fixed income assets, reflecting strong investor demand for liquidity and diversification. The market faced volatility but offered steady income, with credit spreads remaining narrow and corporate bonds performing well until late 2021.  
- Europe: The European fixed income environment remained relatively stable with low yields, though market participants anticipated rate cuts amid policy uncertainties and inflation pressures. The ECB's continued commitment to ultra-loose monetary policy kept yields in check, but investors sought opportunities in high-yield and green bonds. The EU's plans to issue substantial green bonds and progress in sustainable finance created unorthodox opportunities in ESG-linked debt. The overall outlook remained cautiously optimistic, with some markets perceiving a shift toward rate normalization in 2022.  
- Latin America: The Latin American and Caribbean bond markets showed robust activity in 2021, with record green bond issuances and increased international bond placements, reaching nearly $89 billion in 2023. The market was characterized by a focus on sustainable finance, with high demand for ESG-linked bonds and social bonds. Notably, the power sector accounted for over half of the project bond activity, highlighting infrastructure investments. The region experienced a rebound in bond activity in 2023, but yields remained high relative to developed markets, presenting both risk and opportunity. The region's focus on ESG and infrastructure development could lead to further unorthodox moves, especially amid global interest in sustainable investing.  
- Overall, a 2021 strategist would note the strong shifts toward ESG and sustainability themes, the impact of hyper-accommodative monetary policies in Europe, and the rising yields and inflation hedges in the US. Latin America's bond market movements, especially the focus on green and social bonds, stand out as areas primed for significant future movement, driven by global policy focus on sustainability and infrastructure.
