- **Inclusion in Global Bond Indices**: India was added to JP Morgan's reference index for global government bonds in June 2024, signaling increased international recognition and promising prospects for foreign investment in Indian government bonds. This move is expected to further integrate India's bond market into the global financial system.

- **Surprising Yield Movements**: Despite rising global yields, Indian bond yields have experienced declines, indicating domestic factors such as monetary easing, cautious investor sentiment, or capital inflows supporting bond prices even amid external pressures.

- **Market Growth and Size**: By December 2024, India's bond market had grown significantly, reaching an estimated $2.69 trillion, with corporate bonds comprising over $602 billion. This growth reflects ongoing issuer diversification and increased investor interest in Indian debt securities.

- **Foreign Investment Trends**: The Indian debt market is increasingly attracting foreign investors, although in 2022, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) withdrew approximately Rs 1.21 lakh crore. The market's potential for future inflows remains heightened especially with the inclusion in major indices.

- **Issuance and Transaction Activity**: Major Indian firms such as L&T Finance and LIC Housing are actively reissuing bonds, often at attractive yields (e.g., 7.80%). These moves suggest a robust corporate bond issuance environment in late 2023 and into 2024.

- **Structural and Fundamental Drivers**: India’s bond market is backed by strong macroeconomic fundamentals, with some analysts viewing its development as a 'structural growth story.' The market's deeper integration into the global system and a tripling of local currency government bonds have bolstered its investability.

- **Future Outlook and Easing Expectations**: Market expectations are for continued easing bias, with the 10-year government bond yield expected to trade around 6.30%-6.35% over the coming months. Conditions could support further rallying in the bond prices.

Overall, India’s fixed income market demonstrated notable movements towards greater internationalization and resilience, even amid external global uncertainties, backed by structural growth and active issuance.
