The global fixed income markets in 2021 saw notable developments across different regions, characterized by record issuance, low yields, and evolving risk assessments:

- **United States:** 
  - The US bond markets experienced strong issuance, with total outstanding debt surpassing $46 trillion, marking a 5.8% year-over-year increase. The 10-year Treasury yield edged higher but remained historically low at approximately 4.4% in May 2021, reflecting continued monetary accommodation. Market activity was boosted by rising inflation concerns, but yields stayed subdued, supporting a bullish environment for bond investors.
  
- **Europe:** 
  - European government bond trading increased marginally, with a 0.2% rise in 2021 and an 8.7% jump from 2019. Markets experienced cautious optimism despite geopolitical and economic uncertainties post-pandemic. Record low yields persisted in major economies like Germany and France, while some peripheral countries saw yield fluctuations amid political events. The ECB's continued accommodative stance kept borrowing costs low, encouraging issuance.
  
- **Latin America:** 
  - Latin American bond issuance hit a record of approximately $149 billion in 2021, driven largely by Brazil, Mexico, and other emerging markets seeking debt to support economic recovery. However, geopolitical tensions, inflation, and currency volatility created unorthodox moves, including sharp yield climbs in some countries’ bonds, especially in Argentina and Brazil, reflecting increased risk premiums.
  
- **East-Southeast Asia:** 
  - The region’s bond markets grew significantly, with local currency bonds rising to over $20 trillion in emerging East Asia. The high-yield segment gained momentum due to low global interest rates, with some markets like China and South Korea reporting record issuance volumes. ASEAN countries also saw a surge in green and sustainability-linked bonds, with record issuance volumes in 2021, signaling a shift toward ESG-focused debt.
  - Notably, the international bond issuance from Asian countries declined from 2021’s peak but rebounded in 2022, with high-yield and green bonds gaining prominence as diversifiers amid fluctuating global macro conditions.
  
- **BRICS nations:** 
  - BRICS countries experienced dynamic shifts, with record foreign investment inflows and increased international bond issuance, particularly in Brazil and China. China’s bond markets saw an influx of green and social bonds, with the sovereign issuing the largest sustainability bonds within Latin America, while Russia and India’s bond yields fluctuated amid geopolitical tensions and currency swings.
  - An unorthodox move was the rising risk premiums in South Africa’s debt, amid fiscal concerns. Nonetheless, overall, BRICS remained an important part of the evolving global debt landscape, with increasing focus on sustainable and ESG bonds, and some countries exploring currency diversification strategies.

**Summary:** 
2021 was characterized by record issuance levels and low yields globally, with regional idiosyncrasies shaping market movement. Unorthodox moves included rising risk premiums in Latin America and South Africa, increased green and sustainable debt issuance in Asia and Latin America, and geopolitical tensions influencing yields in BRICS. These developments set the stage for a transition period as markets prepared for evolving monetary policies and global risks in 2022.
